# A valuation exercise

Your client is considering purchasing an office building in the centre of a UK regional city. The office building has 10,000 m<sup>2</sup> lettable space and was let to a single tenant (a well-established local financial services firm) two years ago on a ten year lease with a five year rent review and on an initial rent of 2.3 million per annum.

You are aware of two recent office lettings in the city. The first, an 8,500 m<sup>2</sup> building, let for a reported £2.04 million per annum; the second, a 12,000 m<sup>2</sup> building let for £3.12 million p.a., both on ten year leases.

The is evidence from two recent sales where the sale coincided with a new letting or rent review. One property let on a rent of £1.9million per annum sold for £44.71million; another, let for 3.1million per annum sold for £65.25million.

In the city, office yields have averaged around 5% for many years and have been very stable. Rental growth has averaged 2.5% per annum over the long, stable inflation period. Typical total property returns in the office market have ranged between 7% and 8% (occasional falls in value being followed by strong recoveries).

Your client seeks exposure to the local real estate market, but is concerned about market overheating. Carrying out whatever calculations you think necessary, advise your client about whether ort not they should seek to buy this building. What other information do you need?
